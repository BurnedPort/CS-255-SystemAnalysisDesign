# CS-255 System Analysis and Design – DriverPass Project

## Project Overview
The DriverPass project was developed for a client who wanted to modernize the process of preparing students for driving tests. The client needed a **web-based system** that allowed students to register for lessons, schedule driving sessions, take practice tests, and review instructor feedback. The goal was to streamline communication between students, instructors, and administrators while improving lesson scheduling and progress tracking.

## What I Did Well
I clearly defined business requirements and ensured they aligned with the client’s goals. My UML diagrams and structured design documentation effectively represented the system’s functionality and user roles, following best practices in clarity and organization.

## What I Would Revise
If I were to revise one part, I would improve the **use-case diagram and relationships** to show more detailed interactions between subsystems. Adding activity diagrams or sequence diagrams for lesson scheduling would give a fuller picture of system behavior.

## Interpreting User Needs
I translated the user’s needs into functional and nonfunctional requirements by focusing on usability, security, and accessibility. Each user story informed specific design choices, for example, ensuring instructors could securely log feedback while students viewed it privately. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the system is both practical and user-friendly, ultimately meeting business goals.

## Design Approach and Future Strategies
When designing software, I start with requirement gathering, define system boundaries, then use UML diagrams to visualize data flow and interactions. In the future, I’ll continue using **iterative refinement and stakeholder feedback loops** to validate designs early, applying principles from Agile and user-centered design.
